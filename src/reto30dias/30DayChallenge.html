      The best thing to do when you start playing this game is trying to get the
      Luck Glov, since is fast to craft. For this you will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1x <a href="https://sol-rng.fandom.com/wiki/Gear_Basing">Gear basing</a>
      </li>
      <li>2x <a href="https://sol-rng.fandom.com/wiki/Divinus">Divinus</a></li>
      <li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      The Gear basing is super cheap to craft since you just need the 4 easiest
      titles in the game. getting the Luck glove will grant you +25% luck while
      equipped, so it will be useful in order to get rarer auras and better
      items.
    </p>

    <h3 id="auras-early-game">Auras</h3>
    <p>
      The best auras you can get for now are the ones that is used to craft
      items. The next list of auras are gonna be useful
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rare: This is one of the most used auras for crafting. The first ones
        you get can be used to craft some Gear Basings or for other gaunlets
        like the Lunar/Solar ones. Even you can farm this title to start griding
        for the Jackpot Gaunlet, since it cost 777x Rare titles, but it will be
        worth in order to get lot of money from mid to end game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solar/Lunar: This ones are the best ones you can get, and if you manage
        to get one of those use them to craft either Solar or Lunar Gaunlet,
        which grants great buffs for mid game. Also this ones can be used to
        start crafting Eclipse, but only if you already used one for Solar/Lunar
        Gaunlet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Precious/Magnetic/Siderium: This ones will be used to craft the Exo
        Gaunlet, which is the best one at this moment (Era 5 Update) and the one
        you will use in end game (even in mid game if you are lucky)
      </li>
      <li>
        Guilded: This one is super useful since it can be your main source of
        coins in early game (even in mid to end game is useful too) and it can
        make you craft some of the powerful items in the game like heavenly
        potions and Jackpot Gaunlet. If you need space for auras, go for
        crafting guilded coins, but if you want to get the Jackpot Gaunlet as
        fast as possible, try to use all of your Guilded auras in that item,
        since you will need x77 Guilded for that one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackpot: This aura is a must if you go for the Jackpot Gaunlet. This one
        requires x77 Jackpot auras to get it, so the best decision is to start
        grinding for in early game. After you manage to collect all of them you
        can just keep it for collection or auto-delete them, since you still get
        the benefits of the Jackpot Gaunlet (+777 coins just for rolling
        Jackpot, not for keeping it).
      </li>
    </ul>
